# KeepSecret

KeepSecret is a Password manager GUI intended to be a client for a Secret Service
compatible provider.

It can be used with KWallet, but also other systems such as oo7, Gnome-keyring or KeepassXC.

When the service is running (or is dbus activated) this app will automatically find and use it,
showing all the secret colletions and the secrets contained within.
